I've been using **n8n** to build powerful automations that save time and connect multiple platforms seamlessly.

âš¡ **Examples of workflows:**
- Syncing Google Sheets with PostgreSQL and Airtable  
- Automated notifications to WhatsApp/Telegram groups  
- Data pipelines for analytics dashboards with Superset  
- Event-driven tasks (webhooks + APIs) for real-time actions  

ðŸ”§ Why n8n?  
- Self-hosted, privacy-first  
- Highly extensible with custom nodes  
- Perfect for connecting **academic systems, research tools, and web apps**  

If you're looking for flexible automation beyond traditional SaaS tools, n8n is a game changer.
