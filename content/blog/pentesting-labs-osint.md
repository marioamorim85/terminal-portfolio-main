As part of my teaching and research, I've been simulating **internal company networks** and exploring **OSINT-driven pentesting**.

üîç **What I did:**
- Built a lab with VMs: Windows XP, Ubuntu, Windows Server  
- Used **Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS** for vulnerability scanning  
- Exploited SMB (MS17-010), misconfigured Samba shares, and AD weaknesses  
- Correlated OSINT findings (from Farfetch case study) with network enumeration  

üõ°Ô∏è **Key insights:**  
Understanding how attackers combine **public information** (social media, job postings) with **technical reconnaissance** can inform real attack vectors, and how defenders must patch, monitor, and train users.
