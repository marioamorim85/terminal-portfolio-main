For the JoTecA 2025 academic event, I developed **Tecas**, an intelligent virtual assistant designed to support participants and organizers.

‚ú® **Key features:**
- Automated registration and check-in via WhatsApp and Telegram  
- Integration with Supabase and PostgreSQL for data storage  
- Deployed on VPS with Docker + Portainer + HTTPS  
- Built on **n8n** workflows + OpenAI API for natural language  

üèÜ The project won **1st Place ‚Äì Best Academic Project** at JoTecA 2025, highlighting the role of automation in academic event management.
